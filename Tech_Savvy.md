## üìùDescription

We propose to create an immersive and enlightening online platform dedicated to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most revered spiritual texts globally. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for individuals seeking spiritual wisdom, guidance for life's challenges, and a deeper understanding of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings. Our website will not only present the sacred text but also offer multimedia content, stories, and animations that elucidate its profound messages. Furthermore, we will introduce a unique feature that tailors content to users' moods, making the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita relevant to their daily lives.

### Key Features:

1. **The Book: Bhagavad Gita Text**
   - Available in PDF format in multiple languages for broader accessibility.
   - Intuitive search functionality for locating specific verses.
   - Concise summaries of each chapter for quick reference.

2. **Chatbot**
   - A user-friendly interface allowing individuals to share their problems and questions.
   - Personalized AI-driven solutions to address users' concerns.

3. **Daily Verse**
   - Users receive a daily dose of wisdom with a recommended verse and its detailed explanation.

4. **Discussion Forum**
   - Community building based on user preferences and interactions.
   - Like-minded individuals are grouped together to foster meaningful discussions on a range of topics.

5. **Basic Settings**
   - Seamless signup/login via email or phone number.
   - User-friendly options to modify email or phone number settings.

### How It Works:

- **Bhagavad Gita Text:** Users can explore the sacred text in their preferred language, search for specific verses, and access chapter summaries for a quick overview.
  
- **Chatbot:** The AI-driven chatbot provides a unique opportunity for users to engage with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita by sharing their concerns and receiving tailored solutions.

- **Daily Verse:** A daily recommended verse keeps users connected to the teachings, accompanied by detailed explanations to enhance understanding.

- **Discussion Forum:** Users are connected with like-minded individuals, creating a community where they can share thoughts, beliefs, and discuss their spiritual journey.

- **Basic Settings:** The platform ensures a user-friendly experience with easy signup/login and the flexibility to modify account details.

This project not only brings the Bhagavad Gita to the digital realm but also enhances the overall user experience through interactive features, making spiritual guidance accessible and personalized. For more detailed information, check out the README in our project repository.
